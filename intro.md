# Computational Methods for Earth Sciences

Welcome to the graduate-level course on **Computational Methods for Earth Sciences**.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern computational techniques used in Earth and environmental sciences, from fundamental computer architecture to cutting-edge scientific machine learning approaches.

## Course Overview

This course follows a structured progression through five main sections:

1. **Computational Foundations** - Computer architecture, numerical methods, and parallel computing
2. **Mathematical Essentials** - Linear algebra, probability, and statistics for data analysis
3. **Data-Driven Science** - Tensor operations, optimization, and data processing
4. **Deep Learning** - Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and transformers for Earth science applications
5. **Scientific Machine Learning** - Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and operator learning

## Course Materials

Navigate to the following sections to access course materials:

- **[Notebooks](notebooks/index.md)**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks with hands-on coding exercises
- **[Slides](slides/index.md)**: Lecture slides and video recordings
- **[Resources](resources/index.md)**: Course syllabus, lecture notes, and external references
- **[Data](data/index.md)**: Datasets used in lectures and assignments
- **[Extra Materials](extras/index.md)**: Weekly assignments and supplementary topics

## Getting Started

1. Review the [course syllabus](Data%20Driven%20Earth%20Science%20Syllabus.pdf) for schedule and policies
2. Watch the recorded lectures via the [Slides](slides/index.md) section
3. Work through the [Notebooks](notebooks/index.md) interactively
4. Complete weekly [assignments](extras/index.md) to practice the concepts
